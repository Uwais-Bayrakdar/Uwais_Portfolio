                <p>In the near future, I aim to master front-end technologies like React, and eventually learn backend development to become a full-stack developer. I also plan to work on real-world projects and contribute to open-source. My main goal is to land a front-end developer job during university so I can gain practical experience early and grow in the tech industry with a strong foundation.</p>
