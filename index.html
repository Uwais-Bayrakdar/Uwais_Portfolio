                        <p class="projectnum4-description">I started small, i was thinking about only making a product landing page, but rather than mimicing i decided to try to make my own, and soon turned from 1 page to a website, while as of right now it does not have Javascript or Backend for saving, I think the style and build turned out to be nicely done for an beginner-intermediate coder, later in the future i will definetly work on this website, making it have backend and who knows, i might be able to make an actual smartwatch business if i had the chance.</p>

                        <p class="projectnum5-description">I really was happy with the project i made on C, but i didn't like that it lacked visuality, so i thought of rebuilding the project on website to make it have visual also, and i'm really happy that i did this project, it seriously is a fun project to build, and although i didn't do the css part (explained more on readme file on github), i feel like i did this somewhat solo.</p>

                <p>I'm Uwais Bayrakdar, a first-year university student passionate about technology and design. I started exploring programming through C and C++, and recently shifted my focus to front-end web development. I enjoy bringing ideas to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites while constantly improving my skills.</p>

            <section id="future-goals">
                <h2 id="ftr-goals-text">Future Goals</h2>
                <p>In the near future, I aim to master front-end technologies like React, and eventually learn backend development to become a full-stack developer. I also plan to work on real-world projects and contribute to open-source. My main goal is to land a front-end developer job during university so I can gain practical experience early and grow in the tech industry with a strong foundation.</p>
